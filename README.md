Why Commit Conventions Matter

Immediate clarity: Consistent messages make it easy to understand the purpose of a commit without rereading the entire diff.

Navigable history: When every commit follows the same structure, it becomes simple to filter, search, or automatically generate useful changelogs.

Easier reviews: Reviewers can quickly grasp the intent of a change and focus on the quality of the code.

Automation ready: CI/CD tools, versioning systems, and release notes generators rely on conventions to categorize changes.

Faster onboarding: A team that follows a shared convention shortens the learning curve for newcomers and keeps the project consistent over time.
